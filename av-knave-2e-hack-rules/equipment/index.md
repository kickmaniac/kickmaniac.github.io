# Equipment

This section describes general rules for equipment management. Actual prices and item descriptions are setting dependent. 

Most of the equipment **occupies one slot**. Bulky equipment may take up more than one slot (subject to Referee’s ruling). Depending on circumstances the number of slots might change, e.g., an equipped breastplate takes up one slot, but one stashed in the backpack takes up two.

Small items might be considered unencumbering. The decision of what is encumbering and what is not is left to the Referee who will use common sense in adjudicating this. 

What takes up **a slot**: 

- One torch
- One ration
- One lantern
- One vial of potion or a bottle
- A pack of arrows, bolts,  (x20)
- A coil of rope (50’) (optionally with a grappling hook)
- Book ( including spellbooks)
- Holy Relic
- Magical wand, staff or rod
- 300 coins 
- Small lockbox
- Tool (like a crowbar, saw or hammer)
- One-handed weapon

What takes up **more than one slot if packed**: 

- Two-handed weapons like two-handed swords, battleaxes, longbows
- Breastplate or shield
- Obviously bulky things like a marble bust of ancient warlord

What **does not take up a slot** (unencumbering items):
- Piece of jewellery (amulets, rings)
- Gems (unless there are many of them)
- Pencil and a small notebook
- Set of lockpicks


## Encumbrance

Any item packed or equipped above the normal limit (10 + CON) must be dropped or carried in sacks (or other relevant carrying aids, e.g., a stretcher can be adjudicated to hold up to 30 extra slots, but must be carried by 2 characters with their hands full):

- **Small sack** can fit 5 slots and must be carried in one hand (one hand in the main inventory is filled with a sack, so it effectively gives 4 extra slots). 
- **Two small sacks** must be carried in two hands (8 extra slots)
- **Big sack** can fit 12 slots and must be carried in both hands (both hands in the main inventory must be filled with a big sack, so it effectively gives 10 extra slots)

If there are less than 6 free slots in the inventory, the speed is reduced (*carrying too much* rule). 

| Movement | Base | Carrying too much | One Small Sack | One Big Sack or Two Small Sacks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Exploration | 120' | -30' | -30' | -60' |  
| Encounter | 40' | -10' | -10' | -20' |  
| Overland | x2 | x2 | x2 | x2 |
| Travel (per watch) | 12 miles | 9 miles | 6 miles | 3 miles |

**Note** that empty sacks are unencumbering items.


## Weapons 

**All weapons do 1d6 damage**, modified only by magical properties or specific weapon’s traits (e.g., *Deadly* which allows rolling damage at advantage, i.e., roll 1d6 twice and take the highest result). 

All items that can reasonably be used as weapons without being actually weapons (i.e., improvised weapons) have *Weak* trait (i.e., roll damage at disadvantage). Such items include torches, stools, kitchen knives etc.

| Trait | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Brace | Bracing against ground doubles damage against charging enemies |
| Brutal | On critical - inflict double damage |
| Crushing | On critical - choose to disarm or halve the movement rate |
| Deadly | Roll damage with advantage |
| Light | Can be used for dual-wielding. Dual wielding two light weapons allows attacking with advantage |
| Missile | Thrown or fired weapon. +1 to hit for short range, -1 to hit at long range. |
| Quick-draw | Can be readied in the same round as attack (if equipped) |
| Shield Grappler | Negates opponent’s shield |
| Reach | Can be used from the **second row** with **-2 to-hit**  |
| Reload | Requires a round of reloading  |
| Two-handed | Requires both hands, cannot use shield, might have difficulty in tight spaces |
| Versatile | May be used with one or two hands. When used two-handed - gain Deadly trait. |
| Weak | Roll damage with disadvantage |

### Weapon Prices

The prices are nominal. The characters are likely to experience greedy merchants' raising prices by a certain percentage. 

Selling used equipment might be possible at 50% value rates. Some cheaper equipment is rarely interesting to merchants. 

| Item | Nominal Price | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Battleaxe | 7 GP | Deadly, Shield Grappler, Two-Handed |
| Crossbow | 40 GP | Missile 80/160/240, Deadly, Slow |
| Dagger | 3 GP | Light, Missile 10/20/30, Quick Draw |
| Flail | 10 GP | Deadly, Shield Grappler, Crushing, Two-Handed |
| Greatsword | 25 GP | Brutal, Deadly, Two-Handed |
| Hand Axe | 4 GP | Light, Missile 10/20/30, Shield Grappler |
| Javelin | 1 GP | Missile 30/60/90 |
| Longbow | 40 GP | Deadly, Missile 70/140/210, Two-Handed |
| Mace | 7 GP |  |
| Polearm | 15 GP | Brace, Deadly, Two-Handed |
| Shortbow | 10 GP | Missile 50/100/150, Two-Handed |
| Shortsword | 10 GP | Light, Quick-Draw |
| Sling | 4 GP | Missile 40/80/160 |
| Spear | 4 GP | Brace, Missile 20/40/60, Reach |
| Staff | 2 GP | Two-Handed |
| Sword | 20 GP | Quick-Draw, Versatile |

Other weapons follow the general archetype. E.g., a Katana will be the same as a Sword. Bardiches, Partisans, Halberds, Glaves are different types of a Polearm. Maces, warhammers, gadas are types of maces. The prices may vary though. 

**Optionally** weapons dealing different type of damage might be judged differently. E.g., a piercing spear might do half damage to skeletons, and if used as a long club might either break on an impact or deal damage at disadvantage! 

| Item | Nominal Price | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arrows (20) | 10 GP |  |
| Bolts (20) | 10 GP |  |
| Sling bullets (20) | 0 GP |  |


## Armour 

Armour class (AC) is equal to 10 + armour points as defined by equipped armour. 

Each piece of armour adds +1 armour point. 

Each character can wear up to 7 items within common sense (i.e., cannot wear two helmets): 

- **Body** can be equipped with a gambeson (padded jacket), chain shirt and a breastplate (total 3 pieces).
- A **Helmet** can be placed on the **head**. Helmet cannot be combined with circlets and crowns that are worn on the head. 
- **Greaves** (leg plate) and **gauntlets**/**bracers** (arm plate) can be worn on legs and hands respectively. 
- **Shield** can be wielded in one arm on top of the above. 

It should be assumed that gambesons are the **most common types of armour**, followed by helmets, chainmail, bracers, greaves, breastplates. Shields are also common. Classical armours can be broken down like this:

**Leather** [AC 12] - two items:
- Helmet and Bracers
- Helmet and Gambeson
- Gambeson and Chainmail
- Gambeson and Shield
- Shield and Helmet
- Chainmail and Shield

**Chainmail** [AC 14] - four items:
- Gambeson, Chainmail, Helmet and Bracers
- Gambeson, Chainmail, Helmet and Greaves
- Gambeson, Chainmail, Breastplate, Helmet

**Plate** [AC 16] - six items:
- Gambeson, Chainmail, Breastplate, Helmet, Grieves, Bracers

**Optionally** another way to treat armour is to take it in mandatory order: Shield -> Helmet -> Gambeson -> Chain Shirt -> Arm Plate -> Leg Plate -> Breastplate. 

**Optionally**: When looting a corpse there is an x-in-6 chance a specific type of armour piece can be found. 

> **Example**: the party defeated an orc who was wearing Chainmail [AC 14], which means he has 4 pieces of armour on him. A character in need of new greaves will roll a 3-in-6 chance of the orc having them on him. 

> **Design note**: armour found in existing adventuring modules should be either broken down to component parts, or left as a single piece. 
> 
> The latter example is applicable for magical armours, e.g., a Chainmail +1 [AC 15] should be presented as only one piece of a magical/high quality chain shirt which provides 2 armour points instead of 1. This is considered a reward enough. 
> 
> **Alternatively** each set of traditional armour is broken down to its parts, e.g., a Plate Armour [AC 16] is broken down to 6 pieces: helmet, breastplate, gambeson, greaves, gauntlets and a shield. Leather [AC 12] can be presented as a helmet and a gambeson (or a combination of shield and helmet). 


### Armour Prices

The prices are nominal. The characters are likely to experience greedy merchants' raising prices by a certain percentage. 

Selling used equipment might be possible at 50% value rates.

| Item | Nominal Price | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gambeson | 15 GP | Padded jacket |
| Chainmail | 100 GP | Chain shirt |
| Breastplate | 400 GP | A plate or lamellarcuirass |
| Shield | 15 GP | Wooden shield |
| Helmet | 40 GP | Something to protect the head |
| Greaves | 100 GP | Leg plating |
| Bracers | 100 GP | Arm protection |

**Note** that magical armour is almost never for sale and no one is really willing to buy one. It's cheaper to hire some mercenaries for the same price than to get a +1 to AC. Most NPCs don't go delving into the dungeons.
