# Combat

## Combat Procedure 

Surprised party misses their turn. **Surprise** is determined on a 2-in-6 roll, where 1-2 means that the party is surprised.

A **reaction roll** (2d6) is rolled as appropriate (common sense).

**Note** that in the dungeon (or in darkness in general), the party carrying visible light cannot surprise the party lurking in the darkness.

**Note** that all monsters are assumed to have darkvision and do not require light.

1. Both sides declare the intent to:
	1. Cast **spells**/use **scrolls**/use **spell-like abilities** or...
	2. Move while **in melee** (i.e., only the characters that are currently engaged)
2. Roll for initiative (any dice, most commonly d6 or d20) for the entire side. The highest score wins.
3. Combat order:
	1. Winners check morale
	2. Winners' movement
	3. Winners' **ranged** attacks, including **rods**/**staves**/**wands**
	4. Winners' **magic**: spells/scrolls/potions
	5. Winners' **melee** attacks
4. Losers repear 3-1 to 3-5
5. Back to the top of the round! 

## Moral Check 

**Roll 2d6** when NPC/Monsters's side suffers the first death or loses half of its strength. Other significant factors may contribute (sudden arrival of reinforcements, death of leader etc.)

1. If the roll is above Morale - the monsters flee
2. If the roll is below or equal to Morale - the monsters keep on fighting

**Retainers**' morale is checked when facing **extraordinary danger**.

**Two consequitive morale check successes** mean that the party does not make any more moral checks in this encounter.
