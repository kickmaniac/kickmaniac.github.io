# Delving

This section deals with what the Players and the Referee should remember during the active delve in the dungeon, ruins, haunted mansions, underground bank vaults etc. Both parties must familiarise themselves with this section - to know how to adjudicate situations and to know what to expect. 

## Light Situation

The following common sources of visibility can be used in the dungeons: 
- **Torches** last for 6 turns and illuminate space in a radius of 30 ft. 
- **Oil lanterns** last for 24 turns and illuminate space in a radius of 30 ft. 
- **Candles** last for 12 turns and illuminate space in a radius of 10 ft. 
- **Darkvision** allows seeing heat signatures in the dark in a radius of 30-60 ft.

Improvised torches would illuminate the usual 30 ft radius, but will last for 1d4 turns. 

Carrying visible light makes the party visible to anyone who is hiding in the darkness. Party carrying the torch cannot surprise anyone! 

## Entering and Searching Areas

**Exchange** time and resources for uncovering more details about the environment!

Upon entering a new area (room, corridor, street etc.) only the most obvious details are revealed by the Referee . When under duress (e.g., running/fleeing at higher than exploration speed) only a very basic description is given. 

| Difficulty | Explanation and Examples | 
| --- | --- | 
| **Under Duress** | When moving through an area at non-exploration speed (e.g., running/fleeing from chasing monsters): 
- Basic dimensions (big or small room, corridor etc.) and light situation
- General environment style described in broad terms (e.g., a room full of bookshelves or a floor that is covered with 10-cm of water etc.)
- Obvious monsters/NPCs | 
| **First Glance** | When entering an area at exploration speed or slower the first glance impression is given on top of the above:
- Detailed dimensions
- Overall description of furniture, decorations and other objects and creatures in the area. | 


**Searching for hidden elements** that are not obviously visible **takes time** (and other resources, like light). The referee is free to improvise what parts of the environment are harder or easier to discover, unless specified clearly in the adventure module. Searching is assumed to be performed in a **10x10’ area** (3x3m). 

Performing an **unambiguously explained action** will reveal even harder to find objects or at least provide better hints to their existence. Performing many clearly explained actions may still take a turn or even more depending on the actions. 

All non-deliberately hidden or not obviously visible at the first glance objects are considered easy. One turn is generally enough to uncover all non-hidden things within a 10x10’ area. For example: 
- What is under the table?
- What is behind the tapestry? 
- How many objects of some type are present
- Searching through several objects (bodies, shelves etc.)
- Some hints to secrets hiding behind higher difficulty

| Difficulty | Turns | 
| --- | --- | 
| **Easy** | 1 | 
| **Normal** | 2 | 
| **Difficult** | 3 | 
| **Extraordinary** | 4 | 

Some **careers** or **races** provide benefits by **reducing the time** needed to find hidden objects or clues, e.g.: a dwarf will notice an unusual flagstone that is **normal to find** in 1 turn, but it will take a human character the whole 2 turns.

Other factors like exhaustion, deafness/blindness, room environment (e.g., steam or smoke) may affect the resolution too. 

> **Example**: the scone to the left of the door can be turned clock- and counterclockwise - it does not look very different from other scones in the room, but there are small scratch marks around its base, which may hint that the scone is movable. The movable scone is difficult to discover (3 turns), but the scratch marks are normal (takes 2 turns). 
>
> A dwarf is performing a routine search in the area around the door. After searching for a turn, he notices the scratch marks. This whole thing takes 1 turn. 
> 
> In a parallel reality a human character, having seen secret levers in other parts of the dungeon, starts fiddling with the scones around the door (pulling, pushing, rotating). This immediately reveals that the scone is movable and it does not take a turn (this action has been performed within the “active” turn). 

> **Design note**: this mechanic is intended to replace x-in-6 or %-based search for traps or hidden objects present in other systems. This allows players to exchange their time and consumables for secrets without potentially locking it completely behind a random roll. 

> **Design note**: for modules’ compatibility the Referee should use common sense and hints, e.g., if a secret door is said to be normal to find (or 1-in-6 for example), then a Normal difficulty is applied or potentially even Easy, leaving more carefully hidden features to be behind 2+ turns of searching.
