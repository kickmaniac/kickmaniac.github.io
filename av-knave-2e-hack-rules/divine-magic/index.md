# Divine Magic 

Divine spells are magical boons and powers granted to followers of a supernatural patron (deity or demon) for their unwavering devotion. Divine spells require strong personality and bargaining powers of prayer, this divine favours is governed by **CHA** ability. Characters with high **CHA**, but who do not placate their patron will not gain any divine/patron blessings. 

Divine magic is *separated from arcabe* by its nature: arcane is gained through research and mental discipline, while divine magic is granted by a patron (god or deity).

> **Design note**: classical B/X, 1e, 2e, OSE (and other compatible editions) spells from Clerics' and Druids' lists fall under Divine magic category.

> **Design note**: the Referee should separate Clerical and Druid magic from that of Magic-Users and Illusionists where it makes sense. However, if good enough in-world explanation is provided things are negotiable. 

## Casting spells 

Characters can have a number of **blessings**/**relics** active equal to their **CHA**. Active blessings are decided in the morning of each day in case the character has more relics than their **CHA** score. 

**Each relic** occupies **a slot in the inventory**.


## Scrolls 

Divine Scrolls 


### Using the scrolls 

The scroll must be **held in hand** and **read out loud** to be cast. Divine scrolls can be used by anyone as long as they succeed a **CHA check**:

- **CHA check** at **DC 11 + Spell Level** 

Casting a spell from an opposing domain might confer penalties to the roll. 

> **Example**: a cleric of God of Triumph, Power and Domination uses the Cure Light Wounds scroll on a poor injured peasant. Unless justified properly this might inflict a -2 (or more, at Referee's discretion) penalty to the roll.


### Scribing the scrolls

In order to scribe a divine scroll the character must satisfy the following requirements: 

- Be literate in one of the languages
- Be on good terms with the patron
- Spend a minimum of *500 GP per spell level* (the money covers extra donations and materials etc.)
- Spend 1 week per spell level in prayers

## Gaining Relics

### New Relics

Massive **donation**, completion of a **quest** or an appropriate **sacrifice** (personal or otherwise) might grant the character a relic. The Players can describe what they are after and the Referee will adjudicate what kind of spell or blessing can be granted. 

> **Example**: a good aligned cleric spent a month in the local hospital tending to the ill, making CON checks every day (or getting ill themselves), so their patron who governs mercy and helping the poor, grants them a relic with Cure Disease, Purify Food and Water and Bless spells that allows casting of one of these per day. 

> **Example**: a cleric aligned with the domains of blood, death and power killed (dealt the killing blow) 20 living creatures. In one of the prayers his patron granted him a relic allowing casting Cause Wounds or Cause Fear once a day. 

> **Example**: a nature worshipper avoided combat with wild animals who were protecting their home, so nature granted him Invisibility to Animals and Animal Friendship that can be cast twice per day.

Relics might grant **spell casting** abilities or permanent **blessings**. Patrons will *rarely if ever* grant direct damage spells, but will consider passive blessings, curses, divinations, enchantments and other similar types of magics. 

> **Example**: a massive donation of 5000 coins to the local temple dedicated to the patron of trade and merchants  might grant a blessing of +5 to haggling checks (CHA) once a day. 

Relics function is either defined by the Referee based on what is appropriate or discussed between the Player and the Referee, in which case the Referee might provide hints on what kind of actions the characters must perform in order to gain favour of their deity. 

> **Design note**: the basis for Patron magic is Clerical and Druidic magic from different editions of the most popular role-playing game. However, deities local to a setting will grant miracles, divine spells and blessings according to their domains, so one should not expect a Cure Light Wounds from a local god of death. Still one can imagine that local patron of pain, perseverance might grant a Cure Wounds spell with a caveat that the recipient must endure excruciating pain (e.g., WIS check) or scream in pain while receiving healing - such screams no doubt are going to attract attention. 

> **Design note**: potential clerics don’t get any relics at character creation and must obtain them in-game. This mimics the original Cleric getting access to spells at 2nd level only. 

**Failing to follow the tenets** of their chosen deity, the characters might face divine wrath and get their relics’ powers revoked. 

### Captured Relics

**Captured relics are useless** as divine patronage is granted to an individual. The relics might still hold mundane or quest value. 

## Divine Wrath 

Sometimes things don’t go right when dealing with the delicate aspects of the supernatural and divine. Arcane or alchemical failures and divine disfavours can be rolled on the tables of magical mishaps (can be arcane, phantasmal, divine, nature etc.). In a simplified case roll a d20 on the table below and add a DC (based on spell level, for example) - note that durations can be adjusted by the Referee! 

| d20 + DC | Divine Wrath | 
| --- | --- | 
| 1 | - | 
| 2 | Cannot reattempt for today | 
| 3 | Wail loudly for 1d6 turns | 
| 4 | Take d4 shock damage! | 
| 5 | Be weakened by losing 2 STR for 1d6 turns | 
| 6 | Take 2d4 shock damage! | 
| 7 | A small earthquake shatters the ground right under you!  | 
| 8 | Lose two pieces of equipment of your choice forever - they turn to dust. | 
| 9 | An ironic punishment within deity’s domain is imposed on you!  | 
| 10 | Be haunted by nightmares for d6 nights!  | 
| 11 | A wound opens on your body! | 
| 12 | Equipped non-magical equipment rots away | 
| 13 | You cannot use blessings today. | 
| 14 | Become blind and deaf for 1d4 days | 
| 15 | Lose 2 CHA for d6 days. | 
| 16 | You cannot use blessings for d4 days. | 
| 17 | The whole party suffers -1 penalties to all rolls while in your presence for d6 days! | 
| 18 | A quest is imposed on you. You can’t use blessings until the quest is resolved. Quest can be a massive donation (e.g., d4x1000 coins) | 
| 19 | A rival deity curses you according to their rival domain, forcing you to do things against your devotion!  | 
| 20 | Your spell tears the fabric of reality and summons d4 random creatures of d4 + 2 HD that will attack randomly. | 
| 21 | Roll twice on this table and combine the results!  | 
| 22 | Your spell tears the fabric of reality and summons d2 random creatures of d4+2 HD that will attack you. | 
| 23 | Build a temple!  |
