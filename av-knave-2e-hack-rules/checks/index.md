# Checks

## Ability Checks

Each ability governs its own domain as described in the Abilities section. 

The check is performed by rolling d20 and adding the relevant Ability score. The result must be equal or above the Difficulty Class (DC).

Checks that do not have obvious negative consequences in case of failure must be avoided. 

> **Example**: a band of orcs is having a party behind a standard wooden dungeon door. Yeah, they are going to make a lot of noise that even low WIS characters would hear - no roll is needed, unless the characters are exposed to some other negative factor like a fountain in a room which makes too much distracting noise. 

There are **no lore checks** - the characters know lore from their backgrounds (as decided by the Referee) or gain knowledge in-game. **Social checks should be avoided** and are to be used only in extreme scenarios - most social interactions can be resolved using common sense and in-game knowledge. One exception is hiring companions. 

## Difficulty Class (DC)

**Difficulty Class** (DC) is supposed to define an objective (as much as it is possible) difficulty of a task. The DC is set by the referee or inferred from the adventure module.  If in doubt, use the following listed difficulties: 

**Easy**: 11+ 

**Normal**: 16+ (this is a default for many cases - if in doubt, use this one) - something that requires a certain level of competence, skill and training  to accomplish: 
- Climbing a rope
- Listening checks 
- Searching checks (remember that with enough time a character can find almost anything without a roll)
- Open normal lock
- Pickpocket normal humans
- Force a stuck door

**Difficult**: 21+ - something beyond the capabilities of the average person and requires special training or can be achieved by especially talented individuals:
- Climbing sheer walls
- Open hard lock
- Pickpocket thieves
- Swim through a storm

**Extraordinary**: 26+

> **Design note**: in *xDY roll under ability* systems, assuming character generation with 3D6 DTL, the mapping is like this: 3d6, 3d8, 5d4 are considered Normal DC 16+, while 4d6 is a Difficult DC 21+, and 2d6 are Easy DC 11+

> **Example**: a character climbing a rope under no time pressure can freely do it - it just takes time. However, if the same character is chased by a pack of angry goblins who are shooting arrows at her or the rope is starting to catch fire - go for a Normal STR check (because it’s a normal task) and potentially add -2 bonus due to the hostile environment! 

## Bonuses and Penalties

**In combat** STR and WIS scores affect attack rolls for melee and ranged attacks respectively. Careers and backgrounds do not provide additional benefits. In non-combat engagements careers, backgrounds and miscellaneous skills might affect the player’s roll (the modifier ranges normally from -5 to +5). 

Examples of **penalties**: attempting a feat of dexterity while wearing heavy armour. Examples of **bonuses**: pickpocketing in a dense crowd, using an improvised (+1) or specialised (+2) tool, having a specific background or career (+1).

> **Design note**: The Referee cannot remember all careers, backgrounds, heritages of each character, so the DC is set as if there are no bonuses or penalties (unless obvious from the environment, e.g., time pressure, room is on fire etc.). 


## Criticals 

Cumulative (roll + ability score + modifiers) **negative result** with **difference of 10 or above** results in additional negative consequences (a **critical failure** or a **fumble**). 

- **In combat** a critical failure results in a broken weapon. Magical weapons might be allowed a die of fate modified by their enhancement bonus or be judged as simply dropped to the ground or yoinked by the enemy. 
- **In non-combat** scenarios the resolution of a critical failure is judged by the Referee.

Cumulative (roll + ability score + modifiers) **positive result** with a **difference of 10 or above** results in additional benefits (a **critical success**). 

- **In combat** this allows to perform a manoeuvre like disarming, pushing, grappling, stunning, blinding, breaking gear, restraining etc. as deemed plausible by the Referee. Additional die of fate might be needed.  
- **In non-combat** scenarios the resolution of a critical success is judged by the Referee.

> **Example**: in the same example as above, the character is desperately climbing the rope trying to escape the mob of goblins who are throwing rocks at her. She has STR 4 and the Referee decides that it’s a normal difficulty check with DC 11 (being a very common easy task) and extra +4 due to goblins for the total target DC of 15. 
>
> Roll of 15 + 4 STR = 19. This is quite  enough for a **normal success**, the character manages to climb 10 feet of rope in her round. 
>
> Roll of 10 + 4 STR = 14. **Normal failure**, because the difference between target 15 and result of 14 is just 1. The character stays in the same spot on the rope for this round. 
>
> Roll of 3 + 4 STR = 7. **Critical failure** (19 - 7 ≥ 10)! The character actually slips down 10 feet! 
>
> Roll of 17 + 4 STR = 21. This is a **critical success**! The character manages to climb an extra 10 feet of rope for a total of 20’ which is enough to escape through the hole in the ceiling! 


## What tasks can be attempted?

Having a good relevant ability score **does not necessarily grant an option to perform a task**. E.g., a WIS 6 character who does not have any background in herbalism or outdoor survival will still have a hard time trying to forage healing herbs in the wild, no matter how good their WIS is. And even if this succeeds, their INT 8 might not be enough reason to attempt an alchemy exercise (maybe their INT 8 comes from extensive knowledge of political history). 

> **Design note**: if the player insists on trying, the Referee should give a **penalty** for not having a relevant skill/career. The players must be aware of the risks of critical failures when betting with such low odds! 

### Re-attemtpting 

Some checks can not be reattempted until some condition is met. The most common example is lockpicking or trap finding attempts. Failing a lockpicking attempt might require the character to level up first before another attempt is permitted. 

## Saving Throws

**Saving throws** are made with a d20 roll + relevant ability score vs. DC 16. 

Heritage based adjustments apply, e.g., dwarves would have a better chance of surviving getting stabbed by a poison needle. 

> **Example**: a goblin with CON 3 tried opening a lockbox that was trapped with a poison needle. Goblins are naturally more resistant to poisons (+2 to the roll), so a roll of 11+ is required (16 - 3 - 2 = 11). Goblin rolled 18 (+3 +2 for the total of 23) - this is very much enough to survive! 


## Opposing checks

Roll 1d20 + ability score + any applicable modifier for both parties. **The higher score wins**. Optionally, roll difference of below 10 is considered a tie. 

## Secret Rolls

Some tasks/abilities might require a secret roll on the Referee’s side. It is relevant for the cases when the players are not supposed to know whether their attempt has been successful, for example: 
- Listening checks 
- Stealth checks
- How long does it take to recover wounds?
- How many charges does a wand have?
- How long will the potion last? 
- Did the character succeed in brewing a potion?


## 2d6 Catch-them-all Table

In case the result of action cannot be reasonably resolved via ability check or a luck roll the following table can be used to determine the result. The table provides non-binary resolution with mild and critical failures/successes. 

Use this table liberally. Remember that 6-8 are the most common results. 

| 2d6 | Catch-them-all! | 
| --- | --- | 
| 2 | Disaster (**failure**) | 
| 3-5 | Poor, worse than expected (**failure**) | 
| 6-8 | Average, as expected (or re-roll) | 
| 9-11 | Good, better than expected (**success**) | 
| 12 | Great, unexpected benefits (**success**) | 

## Dice of Fate

Additionally a Referee can use x-in-6 chance to resolve situations not depending on abilities or skills. Common examples/suggestions  include (but maybe affected by other circumstances):

- **Torch** going out on impact (dropped or used as weapon): 2-in-6
- **Old traps** are triggered at 2-in-6
- Recovering **spent ammunition**: 3-in-6
- Chance of **hitting a friendly** in melee when missing a ranged attack: 2-in-6
- Chance of **glass** or **paper** item surviving  when direct damage (wound) is inflicted: 2-in-6
- Chance of **wooden** or a **delicate metal** item surviving: 3-in-6
- Chance of **metal** item surviving: 4-in-6
- Chance of **magical** or **unique** item surviving: 5-in-6

> **Example**: a character decides to emulate a sound of giant spiders while hiding in a dark tunnel. There is arguably no associated ability score that can be of help here, so the Referee is free to adjudicate a chance as x-in-6. Potentially a career in performance art might be a boon here.

> **Design note**: dice of fate can be a powerful adjudicating tool, but it can easily make the game less transparent. Use with caution!
