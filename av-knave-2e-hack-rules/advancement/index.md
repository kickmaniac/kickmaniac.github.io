# Advancement

At each level above 1st the Player can allocate a number of ability points to any ability, but not more than 1 at a time per ability (i.e., one cannot get +2 to STR in one level-up).

Some **heritages** might limit how much an ability score may advance. 

Levelling up requires a good nightâ€™s rest in a safe haven. 

A character **cannot level up twice** in one session. If the amount of XP allows reaching another level, then the XP is capped at additional level requirement -1. 

> **Example**: a new 1st level character earns 4600 XP in one session, which is technically enough for level 3 advancement. However, their XP is capped at 3999 XP. 

At each level the player rolls appropriate xd6 to determine new HP maximum. A roll above previous HP is kept. A roll below adds +1 to the previous HP max. Levels above 11+ add a fixed amount of HP. 

> **Example**: a 2nd level goblin has 8 HP. Upon reaching the 3rd level he rolls 3d6 to determine the new max. He gets a 12 - this is his new maximum. If he rolled 8 or below, he would have gotten only +1 to the total of 9 HP which would be his new max.


## Experience Points (XP)

XP is earned by one of the following methods: 
- **Treasure** earned from the dungeon and recovered to a safe location (one gold or equivalent is equal to one XP)
- **Combat** by killing or otherwise defeating monsters 
- **Feats of Exploration** (exploration of dungeons and wilderness, beneficial interactions with the world, completion of quests etc.)
