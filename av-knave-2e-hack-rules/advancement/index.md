# Advancement


## Ability scores' improvement

At each level above 1st the Player can allocate a number of ability points to any ability, but not more than 1 at a time per ability (i.e., one cannot get +2 to **STR** in one level-up).

Some **heritages** might limit how much an ability score may advance. 

## Hit Points 

At each level the player rolls appropriate xd6 to determine new HP maximum. A roll above previous HP is kept. A roll below adds +1 to the previous HP max. Levels above 11+ add a fixed amount of HP. 

> **Example**: a 2nd level goblin has 8 HP. Upon reaching the 3rd level he rolls 3d6 to determine the new max. He gets a 12 - this is his new maximum. If he rolled 8 or below, he would have gotten only +1 to the total of 9 HP which would be his new max.

## Leveling up requirements

Levelling up requires a good nightâ€™s rest in a **safe haven**. Safe haven is a place where the characters are not going to be disturbed during night (but ultimately at the Referee's discration). 

> **Example**: inns or owned houses are safe havens. Camping in the wilderness or in the dungeon is not a safe haven. 

A character **cannot level up twice** in one session. If the amount of XP allows reaching another level, then the XP is capped at additional level requirement -1. 

> **Example**: a new 1st level character earns enough XP to reach 5600 XP in one session, which is technically enough for level 3 advancement. However, their XP is instead capped at 4999 XP. 


## Experience Points (XP)

XP is earned by one of the following methods: 
- **Treasure** earned from the dungeon and recovered to a safe location (one gold or equivalent is equal to one XP)
- **Combat** by killing or otherwise defeating monsters
- **Feats of Exploration** (exploration of dungeons and wilderness, beneficial interactions with the world, completion of quests etc.)

Combat and Feats of Exploration experience is converted at the end of the game session. However, in order to convert **treasure into XP** the characters must return to a **safe haven**!

**Only mundane treasure** can be converted into XP - gold (and other coints converted into gold), jewellery, gems. 

**Magical treasure** is **not** converted into XP - magical items are considered a reward enough. 

**Pieces of art** are **not** converted into XP - tapestries, statues, paintings etc.

> **Example**: a 3rd level dwarf character with front-line fighter inclinations will have spent 6 ability points during 2nd and 3rd levelings. 
>
> *Level 1* (starting)
> **STR** 2, **DEX** 0, **CON** 2, **INT** 0, **WIS** -2, **CHA** 0
>
> *Level 2* (+3 ability points)
> First level up was spent on improving attack and health attributes (**STR**, **DEX**, **CON**).
> **STR** 3, **DEX** 1, **CON** 3, **INT** 0, **WIS** -2, **CHA** 0
>
> *Level 3* (+3 ability points)
> After some nasty encounters and close calls the player decided to invest a point into **CHA** to hire a companion and improve his **WIS** save (having almost died due to a failed save versus a Fear spell). 
> **STR** 3, **DEX** 1, **CON** 4, **INT** 0, **WIS** -1, **CHA** 1


> **Example**: a 4th level human character who wanted to develop as a servant of the divine powers will have spent 9 ability points. 
>
> *Level 1* (starting)
> **STR** 1, **DEX** 2, **CON** 0, **INT** 0, **WIS** 0, **CHA** -1
> 
> *Level 2* (+3 ability points)
> First level up was spent on improving **CHA** that is important for those dealing with supernatural patrons. Additionally **WIS** is good to have for ranged combat bonuses. The character, despite having a bad **CHA** score, has been pious and performed some quests to the local temple of his deity. 
> **STR** 1, **DEX** 2, **CON** 1, **INT** 1, **WIS** 1, **CHA** 0
>
> *Level 3* (+3 ability points)
> Finally being able to have positive **CHA**, which, so his deity granted him a blessing which allows him to cast 2 spells per day from the list of Cure Wounds, Bless, Purify Water and Food. 
> **STR** 1, **DEX** 2, **CON** 2, **INT** 1, **WIS** 2, **CHA** 1
>
> *Level 4* (+3 ability points)
> More actions spreading the faith in his deity and a completion of a holy quest got another blessing to the character, which is possible with another investment into **CHA**. 
> **STR** 1, **DEX** 2, **CON** 3, **INT** 1, **WIS** 3, **CHA** 2
