## Brewing Potions

Brewing potions requires the following:

- Alchemical apparatus (the prices for a complete set start at 1000 GP)
- Knowing the recipe
- A full day of work per level of spell/effect
- Necessary ingredients
- **INT check** (DC is defined by the Referee depending on the intended effect, which normally replicates effects of  some magical spell, e.g., **DC 16 + spell level**). The roll to make a potion is a **secret roll**!

## Buying Potions

Potions are considered a **major luxury**. Basic **costs** for the potion (assuming replicating a spell) are **500 GP per spell level**. Prices will be even higher. 

## Herbal Remedies

Herbal remedies offer very minor, temporary or even superficial (not all folk remedies actually do work) effects. At most they reduce the duration of ill effects (e.g., reduce the number of days a character spends bedridden, battling a disease), or offer another chance at saving throws. Herbal remedies are worth from 10 GP upwards. There is always a major chance that you will buy a dud (secret roll of at least 75%). 

## Antitoxins

Antitoxins are prepared to counter a **specific type of poison** (snake, spider, plant etc.) and **offer another chance** for save vs. poison with -2 penalty **if taken within 1 round** from poisoning. Antitoxins **cost 300-600 GP**.
