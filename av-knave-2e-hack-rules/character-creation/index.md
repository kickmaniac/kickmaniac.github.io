# Character Creation

# Roll Abilities

## Roll the Positives

Roll 5d6 and assign +1 for each ability indicated by the roll, where:
- Roll of ⚀ is **STR** 
- Roll of ⚁ is **DEX** 
- Roll of ⚂ is **CON** 
- Roll of ⚃ is **INT** 
- Roll of ⚄ is **WIS** 
- Roll of ⚅ is **CHA** 

## Roll the Negatives

In a similar manner as for the Positives roll 3d6 to find which attributes suffer -1 penalty, including any that has been raised in the step above. 

No attribute can be raised above 3 at character creation. If any attribute ends up at 4+, re-roll the difference until another attribute is affected.

> **Example**: positive (5d6) roll is 1, 3, 5, 5, 6 which means:
> **STR**  1, **DEX**  0, **CON**  1, **INT**  0, **WIS**  2, **CHA**  1
> Negative roll is 1, 2, 2, which brings the character to the following stats: 
> **STR**  0, **DEX**  -2, **CON**  1, **INT**  0, **WIS**  2, **CHA**  1

The random roll indicates the general direction of character inclinations, but with enough levelling most drawbacks can be negated and the players will be free to develop their characters as they see fit.

## Roll for the backgrounds/career
