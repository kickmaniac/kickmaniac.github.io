# Abilities

Abilities are the main attributes that define the character. This set of home-brew rules is a class-less game, meaning that the Players are free to direct their characters in the directions they want by allocating points during the level up. Each Ability is associated with a classical archetype (Fighters, Thieves, Magic Users, Clerics etc.), but the system allows creation of more generalist characters (analogues of multi-class and dual-class characters in the original D&D). 

Abilities range from -3 to 10. 

> **Design note**: growth of abilities' scores does not represent simply an increase of a raw power of a relevant characteristic, but it's rather an abstract combination of both raw power and experience. I.e., character with STR 10 is not 10 times more buff than a character with STR 1, but rather his martial prowess is that much more impressive. 

## Strength (STR)

Measure of explosive strength and martial prowess. Strength is an important attribute for front-line Fighters. Strength score affects the following: 

- added to **attack** (to-hit) rolls with **melee weapons**
- any **checks** requiring strength (forcing open stuck doors, pushing, pulling, climbing etc.) when stakes are at play 
- **saving throws** versus hold and paralysis hazards where the holding force is physical and outside in nature (e.g., vines or swamps)

> **Example**: a character with STR 2 is fighting a goblin with AC 12. The character strikes the goblin with his sword and rolls 11. STR 2 is added for the total to-hit strike of 13 (which is better than AC 12), so  the goblin is hit! 

> **Design note**: at DC 16 stands in for most of traditional Saves vs. Hold or Paralysis.

## Dexterity (DEX)

Measure of speed, agility, reflexes and coordination. Dexterity is important for Thieves who rely on subterfuge and clandestine activities to advance their careers. Dexterity score affects the following: 

- **checks** related to speed, sleight of hand, sneaking and hiding, pick-pocketing etc.
- **saving throws** versus area of effect blasts like dragon breath and explosions or dodgeable hazards like rays, wands or staves

> **Example**: a character is trying to hide a small item (maybe a stiletto) while being searched by a guard at the entrance to a mansion. The Referee sets the DC to 18 (the guard is experienced and the stiletto is not that small). The character’s DEX is 5, so a roll of 13+ is required, but the Player rolled an 8 (with +5 from DEX the roll is a 12), which is not enough! This is not a critical failure (the diff is below 10), so the bouncer just beats up the character and lets them go. 
>
> Of course, if the character took enough precaution and made smart preparation in advance, such item concealment might be allowed at a lower DC or even without any roll! Play smart, roll of the dice always hides a chance of a disaster!

> **Design note**: at DC 16 stands in for most of traditional Saves vs. Breath/Blast, Rays/Rods/Wands/Staves.

## Constitution (CON)

Measure of endurance, stamina and general health. CON is important for all adventurers. Constitution score affects the following: 

- number of maximum **equipment slots** is equal to 10 + CON
- **damage taken** before dying (when HP is reduced to 0, the damage is dealt to equipment slots).
- **checks** requiring prolonged physical endurance 
- **saving throws** versus bodily effects such as poison, death, petrification, doom, polymorph, disease etc. 

> **Example**: a character has climbed up a wall, hiding from some nasties below. They are handing on the wall for some turns now and it’s getting tiring - all the equipment weight is dragging him down. This warrants a CON check. The Referee decides that it’s a normal difficulty of DC 16. So a character with CON 4 will need to roll at least 12+. 

> **Design note**: at DC 16 stands in for most of traditional Saves vs. Death/Poison/Doom, Polymorph/Petrification. 

## Intelligence (INT)

Measure of logical reasoning, education and memory. It represents booksmarts. Important attribute of Magic-Users who rely on arcane rituals, forbidden lore and meticulous research when dealing with the supernatural. Thieves also benefit from it. Intelligence score affects the following: 

- **number of spells** that can be cast per day
- affects the **power** of some spells 
- **checks** related to logical reasoning, sanity, alchemy, academic research, cunning, lock-picking, finding object traps (lockboxes, padlocks etc.)
- **saving throws** versus reasoning affecting magic

> **Example**: a character with INT 6 is willing to attempt to create a spellbook for a new spell - they use Hold Person (MU) from the classical editions of the game, which means it’s a 3rd level spell. Apart from money and time costs the character must succeed a DC 16 + 3 = 19 check. The character rolls a 5 + 6 = 11, which means it’s a failure and money and time are lost! At least it was not a fumble! 

## Wisdom (WIS)

Measure of perception, attentiveness and how in-tune with the world around themselves the characters are. Wisdom governs ranged weapons effectiveness and is an important attribute of rangers and other outdoorsmen. Wisdom score affects the following.

- added to **attack** (to-hit) rolls with **ranged weapons**
- **checks** related nature and outdoors activities, foraging, hunting, listening, smelling and seeing. 
- **saving throws** versus sleep spells, illusions and phantasms etc. 

> **Design note**: at DC 16 stands in for most of traditional Saves vs. Spells

> **Example**: the party is stuck in the middle of nowhere, so the resident hunter goes for a hunt. She has a WIS 4 and the Referee decides that it’s a normal DC of 16. The player reminds the Referee that the character is from this land, so should know the local game and landscape. Indeed, this is good enough for another +3 bonus. The character rolls a 10 + 4 WIS + 3 bonus = 17, which means it’s a success! 

## Charisma (CHA)

Measure of strength of personality and persuasion/intimidation prowess is important for Clerics who are negotiating with their deities and proselytise among the heathen. Charisma score affects the following: 

- **number of companions** in character’s **lifetime**
- number of **active blessings** 
- **checks** related to persuasion and intimidation, emotional fortitude
- **saving throws** versus emotion-affecting spells like fear, charm and domination.

> **Example**: a character wants to hire a companion since their previous one died a gruesome death in the dungeon. However, the character has a CHA score of 1, so they cannot hire more companions unless CHA is increased! 

> **Design note**: at DC 16 stands in for some of traditional Saves vs. Spells
