# Magic 

Unless specified separately in the spell or artefact description casting magic is **an obvious act to an external observer**, magical items start glowing, incantations are being chanted, unnatural winds start whirling around the caster, wailing of outworldly voices can be heard and so on. The caster must be able to **move their arms** and **speak** to **cast the spell**. 

Casting a spell **requires** a **concentration** for the **duration of a round** (unless specified separately as some spells might require more time to be cast - some might require long rituals). Disrupting the caster will result in the lost spell (for one day). 

## Arcane Magic 

Magic users can perform a number of **spells per day equal to their INT score.** 

Each spellbook can be used **once per day**. To cast a spell **both hands** must be free!

Each spellbook takes up **one slot** in the inventory. 

> **Design note**: spell-casting macguffins can take different forms in other or even the same universe - e.g., crystals, runes or even living creatures etc. The Referee should be cautious to not mix up spell-books with charge-based items like wands/rods/staves. 

> **Design note**: *compatibility* of spells with classical editions of the most popular role-playing game is ensured by limiting the allowing casting spells based on Level and INT requirements. 
>
> E.g., magic tome allowing casting of a classic 3rd level spell Fireball requires both INT and Level to be 3 or above. 

> **Design note**: to reach level 3 (and thus capable of casting classic 3rd level spells) the character needs 4 000 XP, while classic magic-users require at least 20 000 XP, so on the first glance it looks imbalanced in favour of new magic-users. However, this is balanced in the longer run by being able to cast at most one fireball per day and the fact that “slots” (i.e., INT score) are the same for all spell levels. So, earlier access vs. limitation on usage. 
> 
> Additionally classic spells can be adjusted. E.g., the classic Fireball does 1d6 damage per level of caster. This can be adjusted to 1d4 per level of caster.
