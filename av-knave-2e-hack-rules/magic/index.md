# Magic 

Unless specified separately in the spell or artefact description casting magic is **an obvious act to an external observer**, magical items start glowing, incantations are being chanted, unnatural winds start whirling around the caster, wailing of outworldly voices can be heard and so on. The caster must be able to **move their arms** and **speak** to **cast the spell**. 

Casting a spell **requires** a **concentration** for the **duration of a round** (unless specified separately as some spells might require more time to be cast - some might require long rituals). Disrupting the caster will result in the lost spell (for one day).
