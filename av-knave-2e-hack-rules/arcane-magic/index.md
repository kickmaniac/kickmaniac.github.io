# Arcane Magic 

Arcane spells are the energies of primordial chaos weaved into semi-controllable forms. Years of studying and immense mental discipline is required to be able to precisely recite the incantation, perform the right gestures and hold the correct mental image, thus the arcane magic is governed by **INT** ability. 

Arcane magic is *separated from divine* by its nature: arcane is gained through research and mental discipline, while divine magic is granted by a patron (god or deity).

> **Design note**: classical B/X, 1e, 2e, OSE (and other compatible editions) spells from Magic Users', Illusionists' and Necromancers' lists fall under Arcane magic category.

## Casting spells 

Unless specified separately in the spell or artefact description casting magic is **an obvious act to an external observer**, magical items start glowing, incantations are being chanted, unnatural winds start whirling around the caster, wailing of outworldly voices can be heard and so on. The caster must be able to **move their arms** and **speak** to **cast the spell**. 

Casting a spell **requires** a **concentration** for the **duration of a round** (unless specified separately as some spells might require more time to be cast - some might require long rituals). Disrupting the caster (e.g., by hitting them) will result in the lost spell (for one day). 

Magic users can perform a number of **spells per day equal to their INT score.** 

Each spellbook can be used **once per day**. To cast a spell **both hands** must be free!

Each spellbook takes up **one slot** in the inventory. 

> **Design note**: spell-casting macguffins can take different forms in other or even the same universe - e.g., crystals, runes or even living creatures etc. The Referee should be cautious to not mix up spell-books with charge-based items like wands/rods/staves. 

> **Design note**: *compatibility* of spells with classical editions of the most popular role-playing game is ensured by limiting the allowing casting spells based on Level and INT requirements. 
>
> E.g., magic tome allowing casting of a classic 3rd level spell Fireball requires both INT and Level to be 3 or above. 

> **Design note**: to reach level 3 (and thus capable of casting classic 3rd level spells) the character needs 5 000 XP, while classic magic-users require at least 20 000 XP, so on the first glance it looks imbalanced in favour of new magic-users. However, this is balanced in the longer run by being able to cast at most one fireball per day and the fact that “slots” (i.e., INT score) are the same for all spell levels. So, earlier access vs. limitation on usage. 
> 
> Additionally classic spells can be adjusted. E.g., the classic Fireball does 1d6 damage per level of caster. This can be adjusted to 1d4 per level of caster. 

### Captured spellbooks

**Deciphering** of the captured spellbook allows its usage. Deciphering is acomplished via magical writing comprehension methods, e.g., **Read Magic** spell. The spellbook contains the detailed explanation of the workings of the spell, thus there is no need to separately decipher the spell apart from being able to read the tome with Read Magic.

> **Design note**: Capturing spellbooks is assumed to be the most common way of acquiring new spells. 

## Scrolls 

**Scrolls** represent **arcane magic spells** baked into a **one-use item** (normally a spell written in obscure arcane glyphs and code with magic inks). The scrolls must be **identified** before usage! Some scrolls might contain multiple spells - upon casting one of them it disappears from the scroll! 

> **Example**: the scroll is covered in arcane diagrams, glyphs and runes. In the centre of it a coded word that says "Fireball", that can be understood by **identifying** the scroll. Saying it out loud will cast a Fireball spell, but how it works is impossible to say unless the scroll is **deciphered**.


### Using the scrolls 

The scroll must be **held in hand** and **read out loud** to be cast. The scroll **must be identified** to be cast.

 **Identifying** the scroll allows **any character** to cast a spell if they succeed an INT check:

- **INT check** at **DC 11 + Spell Level** 

> **Lore dump**: some gods might disapprove the usage of arcane spells by their devotees! 

### Identifying the scroll

In order to **identify** a scroll a Read Magic must be cast on it. After being identified the activation ritual can be taught to anyone. 

### Deciphering the scroll

**Deciphering** the scroll **allows creation of a spellbook** based on the scroll. **Deciphering** the mechanics of the spell requires the character to do the following: 

- **INT** and **Level** must be equal or above the spell level.
- Ability to **Read Magic** (as a spell, innate ability or via magical implements)
- **1d4 days per level** of spell

> **Example**: Vorthmour the Mage (Level 5, INT 4) has found a mysterious scroll covered in arcane glyphs and pentagrams. This is a scroll of Lightning Bolt (3rd level spell), but Vorthmour doesn't know it. In one of downtime days he attempts to decipher it. 
> 
> The Referee rolls a secret 3d4 roll and gets a total of 5. He tells Vorthmour that the deciphering process will take some days (the Referee can be open about it or keep the information hidden). 
> 
> Vorthmour's INT (4) and Level (5) are higher than the spell level (3), so at the end of 5 days he will know how fireball spell works and would be able to transcribe it into a spellbook or another scroll! 

Deciphering **can be reattempted** when INT or Level are increased at a level up. 

### Scribing the scrolls

In order to scribe the scroll the character must satisfy the following requirements: 

- Know the inner workings of the spell (via a **deciphered Scroll** or an **owned and identified Spellbook**)
- Spend a minimum of *500 GP per spell level* (the money covers expensive parchment, magical inks, spell components, damage fees etc.)
- Spend 1 week per spell level
- Spending additional *200 GP per spell level* can allow more people to use it, granting a +1 on the **INT check** to cast the spell from a scroll.


## Creating spellbooks

### Creating spellbooks from scratch

In order to create a **new spellbook** (even from the existing Magic User's or Illusionist's list) that the character has no access to via captured spellbooks or scrolls the following must be performed: 

- **INT** and **Level** are equal or above the spell level
- Spend a minimum *2000 GP per spell level* (might depend on the environment, e.g., a large city will have a better access to cheaper ingredients, while a rural village is likely to have very little in terms of arcane paraphernalia required to scribe a high-tech magical item such as a spellbook)
- Spend 2 weeks per spell level
- **INT check** at **DC 16 + spell level** (only critical failures and successes matter)
	- **Fumbling** (the usual diff 10 rule) the **INT check** might result in a **magical mishap**, a complete failure or an unexpected flaw in the spell! 
	- **Critical success** might add some unexpected benefit to the spell too!
- Spend additional *500 GP per spell level* to gain +1 to the **INT check**.

> **Example**: Vorthmour (Level 5, INT 4) *fumbled* when creating a spellbook for the Lightning Bolt, so now he has a spellbook that does the usual Lightning Bolt, but he also gets shocked for 2d6 damage every time he uses it! 

> **Lore dump**: Due to complexity and costs, spellbook creation is undertaken only by high-level wizards, and the primary source of spellbooks for adventurers is other adventurers. Since each spellbook is written in the spellcaster's personal code, the spellbooks are never traded (lest your secrets become exposed!), but a trophy spellbook might be given as a reward for a quest.

**Spell Level** is defined by the classic spell level from one of editions of the most popular role-playing game or is defined by the Referee based on the description of the spell given by the player. 


Creation of spellbooks **under tutelage** or in reputable **magical laboratories** might reduce time or increase the chance of success (e.g., if the master wizard favors the character and is familiar with the spell, they can improve the odds by lowering the DC to 10 + Spell Level). **Monetary costs** depend on the circumstances but **cannot be significantly affected** due to the cost of material components required for spellbook creation.

A player might decide to create a **random spell book** at lower cost (adjudicated by the Referee)!

### Creating spellbooks from a reference

Spellbooks are written in the individual magic user’s **secret arcane glyph code** and require deciphering via magic writing comprehension spells (e.g., Read Magic) before an understanding of the spell mechanics can be granted. Deciphering of the captured spellbook allows its usage. 

If in possession of a **deciphered** scroll or an **identified** spellbook the process of creating a spellbook is less time consuming and less complicated: 

- **INT** and **Level** are equal or above the spell level
- Spend a minimum *2000 GP per spell level* (might depend on the environment, e.g., a large city will have a better access to cheaper ingredients, while a rural village is likely to have very little in terms of arcane paraphernalia required to scribe a high-tech magical item such as a spellbook)
- Spend 1 weeks per spell level
- **INT check** at **DC 11 + spell level** (only critical failures and successes matter)
	- **Fumbling** (the usual diff 10 rule) the **INT check** might result in a **magical mishap**, a complete failure or an unexpected flaw in the spell! 
	- **Critical success** might add some unexpected benefit to the spell too!
- Spend additional *500 GP per spell level* to gain +1 to the **INT check**.


## Magical Implements

**Magical implements** (wands, rods, staves and other items with charges) require **identification**, but can be used as long as the trigger action (word, gesture etc.) is known.  **Charges** are rolled by the Referee as a **secret roll** (normally 2d10, unless specified). It is not possible to know how many charges are left. 

## Identifying Magical Items

Magically enhanced items (starting with things as simple as Dagger +1) can be **identified** as a service by a magicians’ guild (at a high price normally), or via **prolonged usage** where applicable. 

> **Example**: a character has acquired a very nice sword (it’s secretly a Sword +1 but also has a +3 versus undead). They decide to practise with a fellow adventurer for a day - this reveals enough information that it’s a Sword +1, but does not reveal anything about its anti-undead properties. A **STR check** might be asked by the Referee - this is left to them to decide. 

## Arcane Mishap

Sometimes things don’t go right when dealing with the delicate aspects of the supernatural and divine. Arcane or alchemical failures and divine disfavours can be rolled on the tables of magical mishaps (can be arcane, phantasmal, divine, nature etc.). In a simplified case roll a d20 on the table below and add a DC (based on spell level, for example) - note that durations can be adjusted by the Referee! 

Mishaps can happen in the following cases: 

- Fumbling on magical research
- Interrupting magical rituals 
- Disrupting casting of a spell during the combat (might be negated by an INT saving throw DC 16)

> **Design note**: alternative magic mishap tables can be used, e.g., from Shadowdark or from Axian Library OSE supplement.

| d20 + DC | Arcane Mishap | 
| --- | --- | 
| 1 | - | 
| 2 | Cannot reattempt for today | 
| 3 | The attempt fumbles with a loud sound alerting everyone closeby!  | 
| 4 | The attempt fumbles with a loud sound, a blinding prismatic light is emitted for 1d6 rounds. | 
| 5 | You start fuming at the mouth and scream uncontrollably for 1d6 rounds | 
| 6 | You suffer 1d4 magical burn damage!  | 
| 7 | You take 2d4 damage of random elemental type. d4: fire, cold, corrosion, electricity. | 
| 8 | Your surroundings are caught on fire!  | 
| 9 | Your surroundings are caught on fire! | 
| 10 | What you are wearing disappears in an instant with no trace. It returns in the same manner as a slimy heap in front of you in 1d6 turns. | 
| 11 | You suffer a magical burn wound! | 
| 12 | You suffer a magical burn wound! | 
| 13 | You lose the ability to cast spells for today!  | 
| 14 | You lose 1 point in a random attribute for 1d6 days!  | 
| 15 | You lose 3 INT for 1d6 days. | 
| 16 | You lose the ability to speak (and thus cast spells) for 1d4 days! | 
| 17 | You are haunted by devilish nightmares for 2d6 days, which prevent proper resting.  | 
| 18 | Your spell tears the fabric of reality and summons d4 random creatures of d4 + 2 HD that will attack randomly. | 
| 19 | An extraplanar messenger arrives to you in 1d4 days, saying that you owe an interdimensional arcane council a massive donation (e.g., d6x1000 coins worth of goods). | 
| 20 | Donate one of your spellbooks or artefacts to an interdimensional museum!  | 
| 21 | Roll twice on this table and combine the results!  | 
| 22 | Your spell tears the fabric of reality and summons d2 random creatures of d4+2 HD that will attack you. | 
| 23 | Be summoned to another dimension as a servant for d6 days. You return with 3 wounds. | 


## Chaos Essence 

All magic comes from the primordial Chaos. Magic is dangerous and unstable and is often treated with suspicion. 

Experienced Mages may attempt to extract pure Chaos Essence from magical creatures (from their remains) or other sources. Such pure Chaos energy is used to imbue the potions with magic.
