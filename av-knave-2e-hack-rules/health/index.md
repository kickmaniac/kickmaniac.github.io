# Health

Consider the **Hit Points** (HP) as an abstract measure of light physical damage and stamina and some psychological damage from stress in a very hostile environment. Consider damage to HP as a representation of bruises, strains, lacerations, tiredness etc. 

**Once HP reach 0**, the damage is taken by the Equipment Slots. 

**Direct Damage** (the wounds affecting the **Equipment Slots** directly) on the other hand is actual **long-term physical damage** - broken bones, 3rd degree burns, deep cut wounds etc.

> **Example**: Roric has 3 HP left and 11 Equipment Slots. He suffers a blow for 5 damage. 3 hits are taken by the HP pool, but 2 wounds are inflicted. Now Roric has 0 HP and 9 Equipment Slots. 

The character can choose which equipment slot to put a wound into. If the slot is occupied by an item (equipped or packed), the item is either dropped or (potentially, at the Referee's discrtetion) destroyed! 

> **Example**: Roric is in a bad spot and he suffers another 4 damage to his Equipment Slots and his life is hanging on 5 remaining slots. Too bad that he had 6 Armour Points worth of armour on him and by having only 5 slots left he can only have 5 items - he chose to drop 2 armour pieces so that he can still hold his sword! He now has 14 AC, instead of 16! 

## Natural Healing

A **full day of rest** and doing nothing else but recovering **in a safe haven** restores **1d6 + CON** hit points. 

A **night sleep** (2 uninterrupted watches and a meal) restores **1d6 - number of Wounds** hit points. This can be done in the wilderness/dungeon. 

> **Example**: a character with CON 3 lost 2 HP in their last encounter, dropping them to 7/13 HP. After the fight is over, they can regain 2 HP, because this is the maximum they can recover after this fight. 

**Wounds** take longer to recover from and can be recovered by either magic or full days of resting. Wound recovery is a secret roll (**default is 1d6+1**, but a table below can be used).

| Wound Type | Healing Time | Cause | Effect | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Necrotic | - |  |  | 
| Slashed |  |  |  | 
| Crushed |  |  |  | 
| Pierced |  |  |  | 
| Burned |  |  |  | 
| Frozen |  |  |  | 
| Psychic |  |  |  | 
| Poison/Toxin |  |  |  | 
| Disease |  |  |  |

## Magic-assisted healing

Arcane or divine magic can recover lost HP or even wounds. Normally divine magic is associated with any kind of healing, as arcane magic is considered too chaotic in nature. If a magic user decides to create a healing spell, they must not only pay the usual price (money, time and the risk of magical mishap), but also have expert level of anatomy knowledge. Divine blessings are more of black boxes to the casters - they just do things because the patron deities, demi-gods and saints cover this. Arcane magic requires full knowledge of how the spell works. 

> **Example**: classic Cure Wounds spell can be fashioned as HP healing spell (as written, but be wary that it does not heal the actual Wounds) and can be called Restore Fatigue. Another spell might be needed to recover Wounds faster.

**Good-aligned Temples** can offer healing (of HP or wounds) for generous donations. 


## Herbalism/alchemy-assisted healing

Unless a potion replicates effects of a magic spell, herbalism offers minor improvements to wound recovery. Mundane herbalism is not a substitute for supernatural healing. 

**Optional rule**: if some HP has been lost in an encounter, 1 HP per CON can be recovered by applying salves, bandages etc., but not more than what has been lost during the encounter. 
- Bandages (1 HP recovery per CON right after an encounter) 
- Preparing or buying a salve, ointment, decoction with specific intended effect might provide temporary relief or speed up natural healing. 

> **Example**: the party bought some herbal decoction that should provide some relief for fever and during one of the delves one character has been bitten by a rat, catching some disease. The herbal medicine helped the character to walk to the exit of the dungeon on their own (albeit they were not able to perform any major task), after which they collapsed exhausted.
