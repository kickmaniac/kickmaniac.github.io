# Downtime

Hints for other activities that the players can have their characters do during downtime. 

## Gambling

The Player makes a bet. The Referee rolls a d20 in the open and offers the Player a choice:

- Beat the roll (strictly above, tie means the house wins) and double their money
- Forfeit and lose half of their bet.

> **Example**: a halfling bets 100 coins. The referee rolls a 1d20 and gets a 12. This means to win the halfling must roll 13-20. He takes the risk and rolls a 2. He loses 100 coins. 
> Alternatively, he could’ve forfeited and lost only 50 coins.
> Even more alternatively, had he rolled 13+ he would’ve won 100 coins. 

## Carousing 

The Players who find themselves with a lot of coin on their hands can attempt to spend a night in revelry. Depending on the size of the settlement the characters will have spent an amount of money (e.g., d10x100 coins in a small town). Failing a **CON check** (**DC 16**), will result in a **carousing mishap**. Examples (might be somehow modified by wisdom): 

1. Temporarily lose a point of attribute
2. Owe money to some important and maybe dangerous person
3. Some misunderstanding with authorities
4. Get engaged
5. Crash someone’s wedding 
6. Make a major fool out of yourself
7. Get into a duel (it’s happening now!)
8. Lose all valuables that are on your person (maybe including magic items!)
9. Start a fire
10. Get into local jail 
11. Buy massive amounts of drinks to local populace
12. Suffer major poisoning
13. Gain a horrible face tattoo
14. Get a drug trip

## Philanthropy

The Players who want to establish relationships with local institutions or people might want to donate to a noble or maybe not so much cause. Such endeavours might be:

- Build a soup kitchen for local poor 
- Subsidise local hospital
- Sponsor an art exhibition or religious festival
- At least buy some rounds for the local guard

The opportunities are limited by money only. 

**50% of coins** spent on philanthropy is **converted into XP**.

Philanthropy has **consequences**! You can roll on a catch-them-all 2d6 table and improvise a result! 

> **Example**: the party decided to invest into building a local hospital, so they spent 60 000 GP of ill-gotten treasure on it. This earns them a massive reputation boost with the locals, which means access to authorities, domain-play, and, of course, 30 000 XP to share among the PCs. 

## Sages 

Sages are **subject matter experts** who can provide expertise in their field, such as history, politics, economics etc. Sages prices are expected to be high, their research will likely take time and a specific expert might not even be present in the settlement. 

> **Example**: the party has heard the name of someone who has been buried in the dungeons. Seemed like a person of some prominence. A sage is hired for 1000 gp to provide an answer on who that person was with hints or direct information as to what to expect. 

## Training

Some NPCs or organisations might occasionally offer specific training or the Player wants to dedicate their **time** and **money** to learning something new. It is understood that knowledge and expertise are expensive and most trades are locked behind guild regulations and protectionism. So, **expect exorbitant rates**. 

Such skills can be negotiated between the Players and the Referee regarding mechanical effect and price (time, coin, favours etc.).

> **Example**: a famous swordsman took a liking to one of the characters and offered to show them his secret technique allowing him to draw his sword and strike an enemy in the same round with +1 to-hit surprise bonus (see iaido). He spent his life honing this technique, so after a week of training the player character can do it with 1-in-6 probability. The referee decides that spending at least 30 days fully dedicated to this art the Character can achieve the success in 4-in-6 chance.

> **Example**: the character got hold of a language textbook and wants to learn this new language. Without any tutor or native speakers practise partners the character can only learn enough of written language, so that they can translate texts in this language with 3-in-6 chance after dedicating 2 months to learning this language. 

Gaining a **new career** requires time and money. Depending on the type of career the Referee might grant the knowledge related to relevant career, attempt tasks associated with it and bonus to non-combat checks (from +1 to +5). 

## Recruiting

**Hirelings** (or townsfolk) perform mundane tasks and avoid danger at all costs. They can be hired to perform housekeeping tasks for the Party’s base or even delve into the dungeon as torch bearers or loot carriers. They are normally hired for a fixed price. 

**Mercenaries** are martial specialists who will fight for the PCs, but **will never delve** with them into dungeons or wilderness. They are hired for a fixed price.

**Experts** are hired for uncommon tasks requiring skilled labour, like translators, hunters, locksmiths, alchemists etc. They are hired for a fixed price. 

**Companions** are the same as player characters, but they gain 50% of XP share. Treasure shares are negotiable and will affect their Morale. 


## Hunting and fishing

Hunting or fishing  in the **wilderness** requires a successful WIS check and generates 1d6 rations that must be consumed the same day (cannot be stored). 

Failed WIS check when hunting might provoke a combat encounter with the wild beast.
